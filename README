Blattabacteria pipeline: gene alignment, cleanup, tree building, and data summary
Authors: Austin Alleman and Kate Hertweck, The University of Texas at Tyler

Run scripts in order as they appears below.

#Gene alignment, trimming, phylogeny building
syntax: blattabacteriaSetup.sh <path to file with *.fas files>
dependencies: 
	prinseq-lite (prinseq-lite.pl) http://prinseq.sourceforge.net
	translatorx (translatorx_vLocal.pl) http://translatorx.co.uk
	trimal and readal http://trimal.cgenomics.org
	phyml http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/
input: one unaligned fasta file for each gene (*.fas)
output: list of complete paths to each gene's *.hyphy file (blattabacteriaGenes.txt) and folder for each gene containing variety of files (including *.hyphy)

#Gene alignment and tree summaries
syntax: blattabacteriaGeneSummary.sh
input: readal.out, 
output: table of gene summary stats (blattabacteriaGeneSummary.txt, column names: gene, alignment length)

#Selection tests in HYPHY
syntax: cat blattabacteriaGenes.txt | hyphy *.bf > *.hyphy.out
dependencies:
	HYPHY v2.2.1 (https://github.com/veg/hyphy)
Batch file wrappers:
	blattabacteriaBUSTED.bf
	blattabacteriaQSD.bf
	blattabacteriaBranchSiteREL.bf
input: *.hyphy for each gene (fasta alignment with tree appended), list of complete paths to each gene's *.hyphy file (blattabacteriaGenes.txt)
output: 
	
#Selection test summaries
syntax: blattabacteriaSelectionSummary.sh
input:
output:
